SYNOPSIS
==================================================================
This demo App provides a way to see the Edmunds API in action. 
It is built using Intel's Cross Platform Development Kit (XDK) 
that lets you create mobile apps for smartphones and tablets using
standard web languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript).


WHAT DOES THIS APP DO?
==================================================================
Uses Edmunds's API to find data on any artist, any album, any song from the Edmunds catalog.

GETTING STARTED
==================================================================
You will need the following to get started -

1. Intel's XDK. Free Download - http://xdk-software.intel.com/
2. A Edmunds API key (Register at http://edmunds.mashery.com/member/register/).


OBTAINING THE API KEY
==================================================================
Before you can begin using this app, you will need to get an API key 
from Edmunds at http://edmunds.mashery.com/member/register/. This will also 
give you a Single Sign-On Mashery ID with access to hundreds of other APIs.


SETTING UP THE API KEY IN THIS APP
==================================================================
Once you have obtained your API key, assign the API key to the 
variable api_key on line 1 of the file api.js, like so -

<pre>
	var api_key ='your_api_key_here';
</pre>

Edmunds's APIs allows developer to access a wide variety of vehicle-centric datasets including vehicle specs (e.g. make and model names, trim, options, colors, equipment, engine, MPG, ...etc), consumer ratings and reviews, stock photos, vehicle pricing and maintenance schedules just to name a few. The APIs available are:

API response and return the information back to the end-user.
